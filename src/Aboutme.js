         I am Saru â€” a seeker, guide, and engineer of both matter and mind.<br />
         <br />
        With a Engineering background and a journey into mindfulness,<br /> I bridge the worlds of science and spirituality in my practice.<br />
        Along the way, I immersed myself in yoga and meditation, and spent six years dancing Tango, discovering the flow, rhythm, and presence of the body in motion.<br />
        My journey also took me back to my roots, trekking to ancient temples in South India, exploring sacred spaces and connecting deeply with their energy. <br />
        These experiences inspired me to develop <br />
        'DYNAMIC ENERGY ACTIVATION' <br />
        a modern practice that combines movement and breath to awaken and harmonize the energy .<br />

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.25rem", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#ffffffff" }}>
  <span style={{ fontFamily: "'Georgia', serif", fontStyle: "italic", color: "#9bf599dd" }}>
<br />Through Ananta Chakra, my vision is to help you explore your inner energy, awaken, balance and reconnect with the formless Self.<br />
</span>

This is an invitation to meet the consciousness in yourself and in me, to feel the harmony that arises when mind, body, and energy align.<br />
